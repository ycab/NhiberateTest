# NHibernateDemo
A basic demo to learn how to use nhibernate in a project based on C#.
I created this solution in vs2013.
In this project I created 4 subprojects, Domain,NHTest,Dao and NHibernateTest.
Domain is used to add entities,NHTest is to help us creat data table,Dao helps us to contact with database,NHibernateTest to tell us my project 
is running well.
To use it you should downland NHibernate in http://nhibernate.info,and get nunit in vs2013.
